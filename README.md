## 🚛 How It Works

   - First Name and Last Name
   - Truck Number

2. After submitting, they are redirected to a link to watch the daily safety video (hosted on Google Drive).

3. Responses are automatically stored in a Google Sheet for easy tracking and reporting in form of Timestamp, Full name and Truck Number.
